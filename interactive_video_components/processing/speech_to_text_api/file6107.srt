1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:08,200
life which is most vulnerable and the newborn
child a son as general hospital receives
the care he needs and is

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:17,110
but that has not always been the case here
where in the past the lives of babies and
mothers have needlessly being put at risk

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:27,700
midwives who would known as the most good
she is working in the unit that was dysfunctional
resisted what they saw as interference from
doctors

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:40,260
obviously all heartbroken call hendrickson
and his wife and islam as a heart stopped
in the maternity unit following the fit fire
was a i'm of my life

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,770
and so much

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,690
you know on a best friend

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,520
so that

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,240
we don't cope with without very well i don't
think more

9
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,020
without loss in the way she died

10
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,160
so a factor

11
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:04,810
you know it's hard pressed to flee hard for
the following day calls newborn son chester
olson died

12
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,200
after several years of incompetence dishonesty
in cover up but the hospital says there is

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,440
the full extent of its lethal mix of deficiencies
is finally being laid back

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,090
today is human

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,420
to cut world is unforgivable and to file
the is inexcusable

16
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:31,460
these woods was spoken just over ten years
ago by a great jump in the patient safety
and chief medical officer for the and almost

17
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,270
those of you have seen every poll will know
that could have been spoken with smoking
by in mind

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:46,280
why sarah brown is general hospital with
that to be in denial pursuing any cost what
they regarded as normal but

19
00:01:46,420 --> 00:02:05,110
but what makes this latest investigation
all the more shocking is that it unveils
the wife individual families who when they
tried to take on the all far to one not give
them the protection and support from the
very and they cast watchdogs was that help
to protect patients

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:16,180
in cumbria families of those who lost babies
at the hospital watch together as the health
secretary gave his response speaking of the
trauma that had ceased

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,890
nothing we say we do today can take away
that i

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:32,580
so we can at least provide beyonces to the
families questions about what happened and
why and in doing so trying to prevent a similar
tragedy in the future

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:41,510
for the very you it's just being the long
and sometimes but to fight against the mighty
many influential individuals and several
official bodies

24
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:53,320
i don't think will be entirely satisfied
that and everything every time i think it
is how does that a safety feeling that everyone
in the in an attack

25
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:06,830
investigations into individual midwives amount
to just continue well many families who should
have had members of one of the best days
of the lawyers going grieving the loss of
mothers and babies who could have survived
