00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,990
Once you have a Map Function returning the data you want from CouchDB, you can save it as a view.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,730
Let's create a view on this dataset so we can use it again later.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,320
Navigate to the restaurant database.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,279
If it's not already selected, select Temporary View from the dropdown.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,150
It saved the Map Function from our previous Temporary View.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,750
If you don't already have this code in place, copy it in and click Run.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,110
We want to save this view, so we have all the content except for the page with the hours.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,780
Click the Save As button, and then type in the name of the design document and the view name.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,220
The design document is something we can use to build an application with later.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm going to name this design document pages and I'm going to name this view without_hours.

11
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:59,450
So now you'll notice that the View dropdown has pages, our design document, and without_hours,

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,700
the name of the view.

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,740
We can go to all documents or we can switch to our view.

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,869
We can also get to a JSON- formatted version of this data.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,850
Remove everything from utils to the question mark, and then hit Enter.

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,190
So now we have the ID for each document as well as the key and the value.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,429
We can also filter this view.

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,670
At the end of the URL, add a question mark, type in key, type equals, and then within

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,369
quotes, type Delivery.

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,229
Now the view is only showing the document that matches the key delivery.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,800
Views provide a permanent place where Map Functions can be stored and run.

22
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,830
With a View function in place, not only do you gain an endpoint for using the data in

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:59,840
your application, you're also able to further filter it by supplying a key.
