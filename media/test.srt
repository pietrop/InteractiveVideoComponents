1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,070
you wouldn't even be talking about you know
immigration first you wouldn't even be talking

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,940
this is not a subject that was on anybody's
mind until like running up my announcement
and i used to

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:28,130
mexico is and except the reporters because
they're very dishonest life generally speaking
in the world the politics they didn't cover
my statement the way i said

4
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,650
the fact is

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:41,840
since then many killings murders crime drugs
for you across the border are money going
out and the drugs coming in and i said we
need to build a wall

6
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:52,150
and it has to be built quickly and i don't
mind having a big beautiful door in the wall
so that people can come into this country
legally

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,940
what we need to see that they're filled a
wall we need to keep

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,090
he goes out

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,060
this is a little bit in thirty seconds

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,220
i'll give you thirty seconds to answer my
question which was watching evidence do you
have a specific evidence

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,430
but the mexican government is everything
at all across the border thirty like a border
patrol i was at double murder last week

12
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:30,780
border patrol people that i deal with that
i talk too they say this is what's happening
because our leaders a stupid are politicians
are stupid

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,750
and the mexican government is much smarter
much you are much more coming and they send
the bad ones over because they don't want
to pay for

14
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:48,800
they don't want to take care of them why
i should say when this stupid leaders of
the united states will do what forms and
that's what's happening with do you like
it or not

15
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,270
all right

16
00:01:52,330 --> 00:02:03,030
obviously there's a lot more to talk about
this we're going to have more questions for
the candidates on illegal immigration but
other key topics including your questions
on facebook

17
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:13,430
were you were doing is making immigration
easier to those want to do it legally what
specific steps would you see

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,300
you can see the two places like to know what
the candidates even if you can see some changes
in my own country again

19
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:49,740
welcome back to fox news facebook republican
debate tonight we're going to continue the
questions now on illegal immigration we kind
of ended with a cliffhanger there so let's
continue the conversation in a case like
i know you don't like to talk about donald
trump

20
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,100
but i do want to ask you about the merits
of what he just said

21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:05,660
when you say that it on the american government
is too but that the mexican government is
sending criminals a that were being banned
both is not an adequate response

22
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:17,780
the question of all the illegal in the right
wrist personally was just saying to chris
christie they say we're outspoken we typically
take the track record that we're really going
to learn that there's something about donald
trump

23
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,390
donald trump to the in this country

24
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,080
you see the number of people are frustrated
they're fair at all

25
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,800
they don't think the government is working
for him and for people don't want to just
two them out there making a mistake

26
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:41,900
now he's got his solutions some of us have
other solutions you know we've got to balance
the federal budget is one of the chief architect
when i was in washington hasn't been done
since

27
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:50,670
i was a military performer former high took
of the state of ohio from an eight billion
dollar hole in the three hundred fifty thousand
job loss

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:04:00,380
to a two billion dollar surplus and again
you know three hundred fifty thousand jobs
respect speculation we talk about all i want
it but the point is that we all have solutions
mister trump

29
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:18,410
is touching a nerve because people want the
world to be built they want to see an end
to illegal immigration they as we all do
we all have different ways of getting there
you're going to hear from all of us tonight
about what our ideas are all right well you
know senator rubio let me back and do better
what you know

30
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:35,310
it is it is simple as our leaders are stupid
and their leaders are smart and all of these
illegals coming over are criminals but let
me set the record straight on a couple things
the first the evidence is now clear that
the majority of people coming across the
border or not from mexico they're coming
from guatemala el salvador honduras

31
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,800
those countries of the for the source of
the people that are now coming in the majority
i also believe we need a friend

32
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:51,440
the problem is a real trouble bill the tunnel
under the fence we have to be able to deal
with that too and that's why you need any
verify system you need an intrinsic tracking
system and all sorts of other things to prevent
illegal immigration

33
00:04:51,460 --> 00:05:04,970
but i really remember casey governor kasich
is and people are frustrated this is the
most generous country in the world when it
comes to immigration there are a million
people a year legally immigrate to the united
states and people feel like we're being taken
advantage of

34
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,460
we feel like despite our generosity we are
being taken advantage of and let me tell
you will never get to talk about in these
debates the people to call my office

35
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:22,010
we've been waiting for fifteen years to come
to the united states and they pay their for
you and they hired a lawyer and they can't
get in and they're wondering maybe they should
come illegally

36
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,320
and so these are important issues and we
should address that it's a serious problem
that needs to be

37
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,590
and otherwise we're going to keep talking
about this for the next thirty years like
we have for the last thirty years film under
water

38
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:51,760
in the water from the two thousand two to
as recently as twenty thirteen just two years
ago you supported comprehensive immigration
reform including a path to citizenship know
you say that was a quick reaction to something
i really thought about

39
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,860
and that you change your mind

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,350
other than politics could you explain why
in the last two years you change your position
on the path to citizenship i know there are
other kinds of positions that we shouldn't
hold to

41
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:24,220
yeah well kristie actually sit on your show
earlier this year if i don't know that now
is that i said actually listen to the american
people and i think people across america
one a leader who's actually get to listen
to them i talked a border state governors
and other elected officials i look at how
this president vertically through last november
messed up the immigration system this country
most important i listen to the people

42
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:43,910
over i believe we need to secure the border
i've been to the border with governor happen
in texas and others seeing the problems they
have there there's international criminal
organisations penetrating are certain base
borders we need to do something about it
secure the border enforce the law no amnesty
and go for the legal immigration system to
give priority to american working families
and wages

43
00:06:47,480 --> 00:07:04,400
and it's really some fourteen hundred people
submitted questions on this very not talk
about the illegal immigration is on facebook
and the number of them were about the murder
of the time in san francisco allegedly shot
down by an elite

44
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:19,810
don knapp reports and this question will
you support case finally for with impose
imposing mandatory five year prison term
for the illegal who supported and then returned
to this country and will you define the same
story city is for violating federal

45
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,100
chris absolutely yes

46
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,240
and not only one life support it

47
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,770
i have four thirty case law and the united
states senate in file that legislation

48
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:41,010
i tried to get the senate to vote to pass
case law on the floor the senate just one
week ago and the leader of our own party
blocked a vote on case law

49
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,250
you know

50
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,560
there was reference made to our leaders being
stupid it's not a question of stupidity

51
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,600
it's they don't want to enforce the immigration
law

52
00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:01,630
but there are far too many in the washington
cartel that supported the president promised
talked about fundamentally transporting this
country

53
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:09,910
there's seven million people across the face
of the of many of the want to come to this
country they come illegally great but if
they come here illegally

54
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:17,200
and they get and the that is how we fundamentally
change this country and it really is striking

55
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:27,990
a majority of the candidates on the stage
of supported amnesty i have never supported
and the state and i led the fight against
chuck schumer gang of eight in the state
legislation and stuff

56
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,270
i don't going to switch topics out and talk
a bit about air and national security

57
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,460
and

58
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:52,170
you said that senator paul opposition to
the an collection of phone records has made
the united states weaker and more vulnerable
even going so far as to say that he should
be called before congress to answer for it
if we should be hit by another terrorist
attack

59
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,470
you really believe you can assign blame the
center apologist for opposing

60
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,590
the bulk collection of people's phone records
in the event of a terrorist attack

61
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,730
yes i do

62
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:19,820
i'll tell you why because i'm the only person
to see who's actually filed applications
to the patriot act who have gone before the
federal the foreign intelligence service
corps i prosecuted and investigated in jail
terrorists in this country after september
eleven th

63
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:38,830
i was deployed u. s. attorney by president
bush on september ten th two thousand one
and the world changed enormously the next
day and happen in my state this is not theoretical
to me i went to the we lost friends of ours
in trade center that day my own wife was
two blocks from the trade centre that their
office and gone through that morning

64
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,450
when you actually have to be responsible

65
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:55,810
for doing this you can do it and we did it
for seven years in my office respecting civil
liberties and protecting the homeland and
i will make no apologies ever for protecting
the lives and the safety of the american
people we have to give more tools

66
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:05,750
to our phones to be able to do that not work
and then trust those people in overseas them
to do with the right way as president spent
exactly what else do they get married

67
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,390
yeah

68
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,080
i want to collect more records from terrorist
less records from innocent americans

69
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:27,110
for him and then we've got a revolution over
john adams said it was the spark that much
or war for independence

70
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:34,480
and i'm proud of standing for the bill of
rights and i will continue to stand for the
bill of rights and

71
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,110
very effective

72
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,070
you know that's a completely ridiculous answer
i want to collect more records from terrorists

73
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:53,310
let's records for older people how are you
supposed to know you support him how are
you so beautiful no matter how you but i
don't know because of the you know it's there
you that make

74
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,680
going to make it like this and answer you
know when you're sitting in the sub committee
just blowing hot air about this

75
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,720
you can see things like that when you're
responsible for protecting the lives of the
american people

76
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:13,880
i mean what she two men many is to make sure
that you know the way to the were probably
governor you fundamentally un misunderstand
the bill of rights

77
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:32,810
every time you do the case you got any more
it from a job i'm talking about searches
without warrant to read indiscriminately
all americans records and that's what i thought
and i don't trust because you know bomb or
records i know you guys him a big if you
want to give them a big over again so i

78
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,700
yeah

79
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,410
i know

80
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,210
you know sort of law

81
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:50,900
well you know the hopes that i remember or
the that i do the families who lost their
people on september eleven th hotel i remember
i know you know for the to i know

82
00:11:51,150 --> 00:12:05,800
nothing to do with politics on like what
you're doing like cutting speeches on the
floor of the senate the podium on the internet
within a half an hour to raise money for
your campaign right and while still putting
our country ratsiraka i know exactly where
they want to get there

83
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:16,310
i is going to be that kind of think because
they have a negative to get i really want
to get to face a questionnaire a and without
shelter and she has a following

84
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,580
yeah

85
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,740
how kind of is actually

86
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,330
and strong in influence in the u. s. they
were you concerned

87
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:38,670
they're crazy want to talk to you about this
because many of the facebook users and then
the folks on but one of the ice of tonight
us the chair of the joint chiefs

88
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:52,570
a question what would it take to destroy
exist in ninety days he tell you i can only
be totally destroyed once they rejected by
the population in which they live and then
you accuse him of pushing medicaid for the
iraqis

89
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,720
how would you just write i said in ninety
days

90
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,410
making a away nato commander and cheese

91
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,780
it speaks the truth

92
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:11,870
we will not just see radical islamic terrorists
so long as we had the president unwilling
to utter the words radical islamic terrorists

93
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:35,020
and general dempsey the chairman of the joint
chiefs what would be required militarily
to destroy i as he said there is no military
solution we need to change the conditions
on the ground so that young men or not in
poverty and susceptible to radical as they
should that with all due respect is nonsense

94
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:45,190
it's the same it to the state department
gave that we need to give them jobs what
we needed that commander in chief who makes
clear if you join ices

95
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,080
you wage jihad on america

96
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,340
then you were signing your desk or you don't
say i am lot

97
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,310
i have

98
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,180
and i don't know the area

99
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:15,670
i think it of course it's an ideological
problem that's one of the reasons why i introduced
the expatriate terrorist act in the senate
that said if any american travels to the
middle east and us is that he or she forfeits
their citizenship so they don't use the past
for come back in the way

100
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,320
on america

101
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:23,840
yes it is ideological and conference president
obamas about the prayer breakfast

102
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,250
it's actually acted as an apologist

103
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,790
he said well gosh the crusade inquisition

104
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:40,360
we need a president that shows the courage
the egypt's president elsisi did most of
when he called out the radical islamic terrorists
are threatening the door

105
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:53,710
hey and this campaign he struggled to answer
a question about whether knowing what we
know now i remember in beirut america

106
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,500
i remember too

107
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,060
and i said of course is now thriving there

108
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,970
you finally
