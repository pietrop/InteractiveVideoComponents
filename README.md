# InteractiveVideoComponents
A collection of node modules that can be used on video projects, centred a round the idea of hypertranscript as a way into the content of the video.

When refactoring [quickQuote](http://times.github.io/quickQuote/) from ruby on rails to node, adding a live video stream as input and export to twitter video API, 
decided to abstracted core components in common between quickQuote and [autoEdit](http://pietropassarelli.com/autoEdit.html) into
# **[InteractiveVideoComponents](https://github.com/pietrop/InteractiveVideoComponents)**
 a collection of `InteractiveVideoComponents` in this repository. 
 
 
Currently this is a work in progress.
